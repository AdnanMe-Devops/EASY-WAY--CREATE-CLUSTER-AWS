What is EKS? -------- 
AWS EKS is a Managed Kubernetes Service from Amazon, which means AWS manages the Master Nodes for you. All the necessary applications/services are already pre-installed like the container runtime or master processes and in addition it also takes care of scaling and backups. üëç
WE only create the Worker Nodes.



--------  How to use EKS? -------- 
To create a K8s cluster in EKS you need to do following steps:
1) Setup or preparation steps
 - create AWS account
 - create a VPC - virtual private space
 - create an IAM role with Security Group (or in other words: create AWS user with list of permissions)
2) Create Cluster Control Plane - Master Nodes
 - choose basic information like cluster name and k8s version
 - choose region and VPC for your cluster
 - set security
3) Create Worker Nodes and connect to cluster
The Worker Nodes are some EC2 instances with CPU and storage resources.
 - Create as a Node Group
 - Choose cluster it will attach to
 - Define Security Group, select instance type etc.

With NodeGroup WE have autoscaling, which means based on your needs depending on how much load the cluster has new Worker Nodes will automatically added or removed in the cluster.

 - For that WE need to define max and minimum number of Nodes.
